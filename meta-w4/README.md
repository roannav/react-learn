# React Course 

For the 4th and final week of 
[React Basics from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/home/welcome) the assignment is to build the Simplest Working Calculator.  Rather than repost that code here, I created this Unnecessarily Complicated Calculator.

The Unnecessarily Complicated Calculator extends the original version by adding on:
- Adds Ant Design components and CSS for better appearance.
- For the buttons, replaces the words (like add), with the symbols (like +)
- Replaces input with number buttons
- Handles divide by 0.
- Handles a result that is 'undefined'.


To run it, from the project directory, type:

### `npm start`

This should automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
