# React Course 

These are my exercises from Week 3 of 
[React Basics from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/home/welcome).
Plus my extra experiments.

To run it, from the project directory, type:

### `npm start`

This should automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
