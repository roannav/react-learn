# Redux Color Change

A very simple Redux app that let's you change the color, using either a button or an input textbox.  Plus a color counter, to count how many times it changed to a particular color.

This is the same as the redux-name-change repo, except instead of using 'color' in all the variable names, I changed the variable names more, to show the connections between various parts of the Redux code more clearly. 

Also practiced using the React hook useEffect.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
